# Simple Arithmetic Calculator Web Application

Welcome to our basic yet powerful calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator aims to offer a user-friendly interface and intuitive functionality for performing essential mathematical computations.

## Key Features

- **Basic Mathematical Operations**: The calculator supports four fundamental arithmetic functions: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
- **Clear Button**: A dedicated clear button allows users to erase all input values and start over from scratch
- **Responsive Design**: Our calculator adapts seamlessly across different devices and screen resolutions
- **Accessible Interface**: We strive to ensure that everyone can use our calculator comfortably regardless of their physical abilities

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - For structuring content and defining semantic elements
- **CSS** - For styling the calculator and ensuring responsiveness
- **JavaScript** - For implementing the calculator logic and event handling

## Getting Started

To begin using our calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory containing the `index.html` file.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage Instructions

Our calculator follows standard conventions used in most digital calculators. Users may enter numbers and perform operations as they would on a traditional handheld device.

- Pressing digits will append them to the current number being entered
- Using operators (+, -, *, /, %) will insert them into the expression being calculated
- Hitting the equal sign (=) will compute the result based on the provided inputs
- Clicking the "C" button will remove all input values and return the calculator to its initial state

## Known Limitations

While we have made every effort to create a reliable and functional calculator, there are some limitations worth noting:

- Scientific notation is also unavailable
- Advanced mathematical features such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, etc., are absent

We welcome contributions aimed at addressing these shortcomings and improving the overall experience of our calculator.
